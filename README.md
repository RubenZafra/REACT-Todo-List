# Todo-List

I created a React App that lets you put a list of tasks in the order that you put them, the newer the higher on the list. Saves them for the future so it doesn't reset everytime you open it. Lets you edit and delete the tasks as well. ![SCR-20220924-pr7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90968035/192108882-623abdb5-7390-403a-8895-2dd583ade474.png)
